# ABCU Course Program
***
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course**

I was finding the best data strucutre for ABCU's program. They wanted a data structure with the lowest runtime complexity.
***
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I started by building an evaluation with pseudocode and runtime analysises. I proceeded to build from this evaluation into a working c++ program. Data structures are important to understand because without it we would have a terrible runtime complexity that would slow their program down signficantly as they added courses to the program.
***
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

The first roadblock I encountered was understanding the complexities of the various runtimes. Once I was able to understand the best practices for understanding these complexities I was able to move on and complete my evaluation. The second roadblock I faced was during my coding implementation. I had overlooked that you cannot hash a string value directly. I proceeded to come up with the hashing method of summing the strings char decimal values to be hashed.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

Work in this project will forever change my understanding because of my new ability of creating time complexities and runtime analysis. This tool will allow me to explain and understand how a program handles data in large formats.
***
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This project has allowed me to evolve the way I write programs by incorporating more inline documentation and robust pseudocode with runtime analysis.
